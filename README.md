# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python script for implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viji514/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

2. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link and place it in the root directory of the project.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice.

4. Run the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Results

The script will train a linear regression model on the provided dataset and evaluate its performance using mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R^2 score. Additionally, it will generate a scatter plot to visualize the actual vs. predicted house prices.
